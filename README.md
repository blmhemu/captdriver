# captdriver - alternative driver for Canon CAPT printers

**Captdriver is a free (as in speech) alternative driver** for Canon 
printers that can only accept the proprietary CAPT communications
protocol and associated data stream formats.

Captdriver aims to be a portable and reliable driver that can extend
the service life of existing CAPT-only printers by extending support
to newer and more operating systems.

For installation instructions and technical information, please check
the [Captdriver Wiki](https://github.com/mounaiban/captdriver/wiki).
