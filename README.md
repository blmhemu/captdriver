# captdriver

## Foreword
**Captdriver is a free (as in speech) alternative driver** for Canon 
printers that can only accept the proprietary CAPT data stream format.
It aims to be a reliable and truly portable alternative driver. 
It's free and open source, so you can take part in its development, 
and help with expanding support, adding new features, and most importantly,
maintaining its codebase.

As Captdriver is almost completely written in C, and uses the 
Common Unix Printing System (*CUPS*), it is potentially compatible
with any operating system with a working copy of CUPS, regardless of
hardware architecture.

As a bonus for users on x86-64 hardware, Captdriver eliminates the
need to install 32-bit libraries on your 64-bit operating system.

## Status
Captdriver is currently admittedly far from complete. The driver is
under active development, but updates are sporadic. For details, look
in these places:

* [Releases](https://github.com/mounaiban/captdriver/releases)
* [Issues](https://github.com/mounaiban/captdriver/issues)
* [Issues on the original repository](https://github.com/agalakhov/captdriver/issues)
* [Wiki](https://github.com/mounaiban/captdriver/wiki)

Four printer families have been successfully used with this driver:

* LBP2900/LBP2900B
* LBP3000
* LBP3010/LBP3018/LBP3050
* [LBP3100/LBP3108/LBP3150](https://github.com/agalakhov/captdriver/issues/13)
