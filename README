This is a dead branch of Captdriver, a libre printer driver
to allow printing from the Common Unix Printing System (CUPS)
to certain Canon printers that only support the Canon Advanced
Printing Technology (CAPT) control protocol and associated data
formats.

This branch will not be updated. However, it has been retained
in the source tree to serve as a historical reference, just in
case it might be useful for troubleshooting regressions.

To get the latest release, return to the master branch.
Alternatively, check the releases or the issues section.

This branch contains a hack that was intended to allow the
LBP2900 to print again, on Raspberry Pi computers running 
Raspbian or Raspberry Pi OS.

It was discovered that on Raspbian/Raspberry Pi OS and several
other operating systems, the LBP2900 was unable to initiate a
print job after changes introduced in commit 75f78a8. This
has been discussed in the following Issues:

agalakhov/#7 https://github.com/agalakhov/captdriver/issues/7
mounaiban/#3 https://github.com/mounaiban/captdriver/issues/3

In this branch, the driver waits for the CAPT_FL_PROCESSING flag
in the status register to become OFF before sending the job
prologue. The LBP2900 still fails to print with this change.
