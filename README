This is a dead branch of Captdriver, a libre printer driver
to allow printing from the Common Unix Printing System (CUPS)
to certain Canon printers that only support the Canon Advanced
Printing Technology (CAPT) control protocol and associated data
formats.

This branch will not be updated. However, it has been retained
in the source tree to serve as a historical reference, just in
case it might be useful for troubleshooting regressions.

To get the latest release, return to the master branch.
Alternatively, check the releases or the issues section.

This branch attempts to use a secondary libusb 1.0 handle to
communicate directly with the printer, bypassing CUPS' own USB
backend. However, the secondary handle refuses to work and keeps
bailing out with LIBUSB_ERROR_TIMEOUT.

The exact cause of the failure and the means of getting it to work
is left as an exercise for the reader.

The CUPS USB backend has proven somewhat unreliable in supporting
the full-time bi-directional CAPT protocol, and the secondary handle
was intended to support a more reliable bi-directional link to the
printer.

Additional setup is required for compilation and use:

1. pkg-config and the libusb 1.0 development package must be
   installed to successfully compile this branch.

   * The libusb development package is named libusb-1.0-0-dev
     on APT and libusb1-devel on DNF

2. A udev rule must be added to /etc/udev/rules.d/ to enable
   rootless access to the printer device.

   * Refer to the Mounaiban Captdriver Wiki for instructions on
     how to do this: https://github.com/mounaiban/captdriver/wiki/
