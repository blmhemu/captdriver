This is a dead branch of Captdriver, a libre printer driver
to allow printing from the Common Unix Printing System (CUPS)
to certain Canon printers that only support the Canon Advanced
Printing Technology (CAPT) control protocol and associated data
formats.

This branch will not be updated. However, it has been retained
in the source tree to serve as a historical reference, just in
case it might be useful for troubleshooting regressions.

To get the latest release, return to the master branch.
Alternatively, check the releases or the issues section.

The changes within this branch were part of an attempt to
enable full-speed printing on the LBP3000 by matching the page
parameters used in the original Windows drivers. This did not
enable full-speed printing as expected.

An observation was made that CUPS rasters (as of 2.2.10) had
slightly different sizes from those allegedly used by the
original Windows drivers, leading to inconsistencies in page
parameters. It was thus hypothesised that mismatched page
parameters alone had been causing the printer to hesitate
between pages. The changes in this branch failed to verify this
hypothesis.
