This is a dead branch of Captdriver, a libre printer driver
to allow printing from the Common Unix Printing System (CUPS)
to certain Canon printers that only support the Canon Advanced
Printing Technology (CAPT) control protocol and associated data
formats.

This branch will not be updated. However, it has been retained
in the source tree to serve as a historical reference, just in
case it might be useful for troubleshooting regressions.

To get the latest release, return to the master branch.
Alternatively, check the releases or the issues section.

This branch contains a hack that was intended to allow the
LBP2900 to print after the first print job on Raspberry Pi
computers running Raspbian or Raspberry Pi OS without power
cycling the printer.

It was discovered that on Raspbian/Raspberry Pi OS and several
other operating systems, the LBP2900 was unable to initiate a
print job after changes introduced in commit 75f78a8. This
has been discussed in the following Issues:

agalakhov/#7 https://github.com/agalakhov/captdriver/issues/7
mounaiban/#3 https://github.com/mounaiban/captdriver/issues/3

In this branch, the lower 16 bits of the CUPS job ID was used
as the CAPT job number in prn_lbp2900.c, in an attempt to mimic
the way jobs were dispatched in 216fddb and earlier, yet with 
a greater degree of flexibility. However, the changes failed to
resolve the issue at large.
